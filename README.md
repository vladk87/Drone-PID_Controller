# Drone PID Controller ‚Äì STM32 Project

This project implements a real-time PID-based flight controller for a quadcopter using an STM32 Nucleo-L432KC microcontroller. It features motor control via PWM, altitude measurement using a Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor (VL53L0X), and orientation stabilization with a 3-axis gyroscope (LSM9DS1). The system aims to achieve stable lift, autonomous hover, and basic altitude control.
